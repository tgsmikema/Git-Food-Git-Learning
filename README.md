## Introduction
Git Food is a website game for helping learners master the concepts of Git, based on multi educational theories, such as Behaviourism, Scaffolding, Gamification, Connectivism etc. The game guides users through different scenarios and challenges, gradually introducing Git concepts and techniques.
